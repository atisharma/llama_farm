# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. There is a lot to be done.

### Issues and testing

TBD

### Documentation

At the moment, the readme file, the code and the help file is the only documentation.

### Pull requests

- The codebase is new so is in a state of flux. It needs some reorganisation.
- The code is in [Hy 0.26.0](https://docs.hylang.org). Python contributions will be considered if they are orthogonal to the rest of the code.
- If you are more used to python, you can use `hy2py` to see what the existing code looks like.
- Please try to keep consistent with the style - more like clojure and less like java.
- Short and simple functions are preferred. The code should fit inside your head.
- Try to avoid heavy dependencies.
- Please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
