Contributions are welcome. There is a lot to be done.

### Issues and testing

### Documentation

At the moment, the code is the only documentation.

### Pull requests

The code is in Hy 0.26.0.
Please try to keep consistent with the style - more like clojure and less like java.
If you are more used to python, you can use `hy2py` to see what the existing code is doing.
