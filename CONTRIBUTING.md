# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. There is a lot to be done.

### Issues and testing

TBD

### Documentation

At the moment, the code is the only documentation.

### Pull requests

The codebase is new so is in a state of flux. It needs some reorganisation.
The code is in [Hy 0.26.0](https://docs.hylang.org).

Please try to keep consistent with the style - more like clojure and less like java.
If you are more used to python, you can use `hy2py` to see what the existing code looks like.
